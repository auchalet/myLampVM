# My LAMP VM

This is just a Vagrant box with the stack I regularly use at work and for personnal projects. Based on ubuntu/trusty, nothing fancy, provisioned with a good ol' bash file, noob friendly. 

```
git clone https://github.com/vince-db/myLampVM.git
cd myLampVM
vagrant up
```

Then go to [http;//192.168.33.10](http://192.168.33.10) and you are good to go.
